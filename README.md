## Fullstack_TS-webbshop

This **E-commerce** application allows clients to **Sign Up** for the App. Once the client **logs in successfully**, a list of buyable items shows, and the client can choose which one to buy. Clients can at any time **see all the bought items**, **the total price** of the bought products, **the purchase status** of the order, and **remove a product from _Cart_**.

To run the client side of the App, change the working directory to point to the **frontend folder** of the app and `run npm start`. To run the App server, change the working directory to point to the **backend folder**, and `run npm start`. For this project, I used a docker image to initialize MongoDB, so remember you have to install docker!
